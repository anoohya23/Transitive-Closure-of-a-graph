The object of this program is to read an oriented graph represented by pairs of nodes, and compute its transitive closure.  as output, you are required to draw the original graph as well as its transitive closure.

Transitive Closure of the graph
1.	Enter the total Nodes
2.	Enter N1 N2  (N1 space N2 )
3.	Once done with adding edges just press ENTER to exit the loop.
4.	The adjacency matrix and transitive closure of graph is printed.
